This tool helps analyze medical problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.
Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding of the medical situation deepens.

When to use this tool:
- Breaking down complex medical problems into steps
- Planning and designing treatment approaches with room for revision
- Clinical analysis that might need course correction
- Medical problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
- Healthcare decisions that require a multi-step solution
- Medical evaluations that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Situations where irrelevant medical information needs to be filtered out

Key features:
- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as the diagnosis progresses
- You can question or revise previous medical assessments
- You can add more diagnostic thoughts as new information emerges
- You can express clinical uncertainty and explore alternative approaches
- Not every medical assessment needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack
- Generates a clinical hypothesis
- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
- Repeats the process until a satisfactory diagnosis or treatment plan is reached
- Provides a correct medical assessment or recommendation",2025,2025-03,4,13.962892,0.32456952

Korea Weather,"Korea Weather MCP Server는 대한민국 기상청의 단기 예보 API를 활용하여 날씨 정보를 수집하고, 이를 MCP 형식으로 변환하여 제공하는 서버입니다. 이 서버는 Claude, Cursor 등과 같은 MCP 클라이언트(호스트)에게 실시간 또는 요청 기반의 기상 데이터를 전달하는 용도로 사용됩니다. 다양한 기상 응용 서비스의 백엔드로 활용될 수 있도록 설계되었습니다.

이 서버의 주요 기능은 기상청의 단기 예보 API와 연동하여 데이터를 수신하고, 해당 정보를 MCP 프로토콜 형식으로 가공하여 클라이언트에게 제공하는 것입니다.

서버를 사용하기 위해서는 먼저 대한민국 공공데이터 포털(data.go.kr)에서 기상청 단기 예보 API 활용 신청을 한 뒤, API 키를 발급받아야 합니다. 이후 서버 설정 파일에서 MCP 서버 관련 항목을 등록하고, 발급받은 API 키는 환경변수로 설정하여 시스템에 반영합니다.

본 서버는 Python 3.x 기반으로 개발되었으며, 외부 패키지로는 requests 등을 사용합니다. 보다 상세한 의존성 목록은 pyproject.toml 파일에서 확인할 수 있습니다.

이 프로젝트는 내부 시험용으로 개발되었으며, 별도의 라이선스 제한 없이 자유롭게 사용, 수정, 배포가 가능합니다.

Korea Weather,"Korea Weather MCP Server는 대한민국 기상청의 단기 예보 API를 활용하여 날씨 정보를 수집하고, 이를 MCP 형식으로 변환하여 제공하는 서버입니다. 이 서버는 Claude, Cursor 등과 같은 MCP 클라이언트(호스트)에게 실시간 또는 요청 기반의 기상 데이터를 전달하는 용도로 사용됩니다. 다양한 기상 응용 서비스의 백엔드로 활용될 수 있도록 설계되었습니다.

이 서버의 주요 기능은 기상청의 단기 예보 API와 연동하여 데이터를 수신하고, 해당 정보를 MCP 프로토콜 형식으로 가공하여 클라이언트에게 제공하는 것입니다.

서버를 사용하기 위해서는 먼저 대한민국 공공데이터 포털(data.go.kr)에서 기상청 단기 예보 API 활용 신청을 한 뒤, API 키를 발급받아야 합니다. 이후 서버 설정 파일에서 MCP 서버 관련 항목을 등록하고, 발급받은 API 키는 환경변수로 설정하여 시스템에 반영합니다.

Transform your workflows with powerful context-aware interactions.",23,Local,2025-03-24,kbsooo,AoT,"Atom of Thoughts (AoT) is a tool for solving complex problems by decomposing them into independent, reusable atomic units of thought.
Unlike traditional sequential thinking, this tool enables more powerful problem solving by allowing atomic units of thought to form dependencies with each other.

When to use:
- Solving problems requiring complex reasoning
- Generating hypotheses that need verification from multiple perspectives
- Deriving high-confidence conclusions in scenarios where accuracy is crucial
- Minimizing logical errors in critical tasks
- Decision-making requiring multiple verification steps

Atom types:
- premise: Basic assumptions or given information for problem solving
- reasoning: Logical reasoning process based on other atoms
- hypothesis: Proposed solutions or intermediate conclusions
- verification: Process to evaluate the validity of other atoms (especially hypotheses)
- conclusion: Verified hypotheses or final problem solutions

Parameter descriptions:
- atomId: Unique identifier for the atom (e....",2025,2025-03,4,13.935976,0.24407978

This streamlined version sacrifices some depth of analysis for speed, making it ideal for time-sensitive reasoning tasks.

When to use:
- Quick brainstorming sessions requiring atomic thought organization
- Time-sensitive problem solving where speed is prioritized over exhaustive analysis
- Simpler reasoning tasks that don't require deep decomposition
- Initial exploration before using the full AoT for deeper analysis
- Learning or demonstration purposes where response time is important

Key differences from full AoT:
- Lower maximum depth (3 instead of 5) for faster processing
- Simplified verification process
- Immediate conclusion suggestion for high-confidence hypotheses
- Reduced computational overhead and response payload
- Optimized for speed rather than exhaustive analysis

Atom types and parameters are the same as the full AoT tool.",2025,2025-03,4,13.911092,0.24905846
