Korea Weather,"Korea Weather MCP Server는 대한민국 기상청의 단기 예보 API를 활용하여 날씨 정보를 수집하고, 이를 MCP 형식으로 변환하여 제공하는 서버입니다. 이 서버는 Claude, Cursor 등과 같은 MCP 클라이언트(호스트)에게 실시간 또는 요청 기반의 기상 데이터를 전달하는 용도로 사용됩니다. 다양한 기상 응용 서비스의 백엔드로 활용될 수 있도록 설계되었습니다.

이 서버의 주요 기능은 기상청의 단기 예보 API와 연동하여 데이터를 수신하고, 해당 정보를 MCP 프로토콜 형식으로 가공하여 클라이언트에게 제공하는 것입니다.

서버를 사용하기 위해서는 먼저 대한민국 공공데이터 포털(data.go.kr)에서 기상청 단기 예보 API 활용 신청을 한 뒤, API 키를 발급받아야 합니다. 이후 서버 설정 파일에서 MCP 서버 관련 항목을 등록하고, 발급받은 API 키는 환경변수로 설정하여 시스템에 반영합니다.

본 서버는 Python 3.x 기반으로 개발되었으며, 외부 패키지로는 requests 등을 사용합니다. 보다 상세한 의존성 목록은 pyproject.toml 파일에서 확인할 수 있습니다.

이 프로젝트는 내부 시험용으로 개발되었으며, 별도의 라이선스 제한 없이 자유롭게 사용, 수정, 배포가 가능합니다.

Transform your workflows with powerful context-aware interactions.",23,Local,3/24/2025,kbsooo,AoT,"Atom of Thoughts (AoT) is a tool for solving complex problems by decomposing them into independent, reusable atomic units of thought.
Unlike traditional sequential thinking, this tool enables more powerful problem solving by allowing atomic units of thought to form dependencies with each other.

When to use:
- Solving problems requiring complex reasoning
- Generating hypotheses that need verification from multiple perspectives
- Deriving high-confidence conclusions in scenarios where accuracy is crucial
- Minimizing logical errors in critical tasks
- Decision-making requiring multiple verification steps

Atom types:
- premise: Basic assumptions or given information for problem solving
- reasoning: Logical reasoning process based on other atoms
- hypothesis: Proposed solutions or intermediate conclusions
- verification: Process to evaluate the validity of other atoms (especially hypotheses)
- conclusion: Verified hypotheses or final problem solutions

This streamlined version sacrifices some depth of analysis for speed, making it ideal for time-sensitive reasoning tasks.

When to use:
- Quick brainstorming sessions requiring atomic thought organization
- Time-sensitive problem solving where speed is prioritized over exhaustive analysis
- Simpler reasoning tasks that don't require deep decomposition
- Initial exploration before using the full AoT for deeper analysis
- Learning or demonstration purposes where response time is important

Key differences from full AoT:
- Lower maximum depth (3 instead of 5) for faster processing
- Simplified verification process
- Immediate conclusion suggestion for high-confidence hypotheses
- Reduced computational overhead and response payload
- Optimized for speed rather than exhaustive analysis
