Afterwards, the MCP server -related item is registered in the server configuration file, and the issued API key is set as an environment variable and reflected in the system.\n\nThis server was developed based on Python 3.X, and it uses Requests as an external package. More detailed dependencies can be found in the pyproject.toml file.\n\nThe project was developed for internal testing and can be freely used, modified and distributed without a separate license restriction.\n\nPlease contact the Korea Aerospace Research Institute's chills (ohhan@kari.re.kr) for server -related inquiries.",
