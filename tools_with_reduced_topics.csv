Korea Weather,"Korea Weather MCP Server is a server that collects weather information using the Korean Meteorological Agency's short -term forecast API and converts it in an MCP format. This server is used to deliver real -time or request -based weather data to MCP clients such as Claude, Cursor, etc. It is designed to be used as a backend for various weather applications.

The main function of this server is to receive data in conjunction with the Meteorological Agency's short -term forecast API, and to provide the information to the client by processing the information in the MCP protocol format.

In order to use the server, you must first apply for a short -term forecast API in the Korea Public Data Portal (data.go.kr) and obtain an API key. Afterwards, the MCP server -related item is registered in the server configuration file, and the issued API key is set as an environment variable and reflected in the system.

This server was developed based on Python 3.X, and it uses Requests as an external package. More detailed dependencies can be found in the pyproject.toml file.

The project was developed for internal testing and can be freely used, modified and distributed without a separate license restriction.

Unlike traditional sequential thinking, this tool enables more powerful problem solving by allowing atomic units of thought to form dependencies with each other.

When to use:
- Solving problems requiring complex reasoning
- Generating hypotheses that need verification from multiple perspectives
- Deriving high-confidence conclusions in scenarios where accuracy is crucial
- Minimizing logical errors in critical tasks
- Decision-making requiring multiple verification steps

Atom types:
- premise: Basic assumptions or given information for problem solving
- reasoning: Logical reasoning process based on other atoms
- hypothesis: Proposed solutions or intermediate conclusions
- verification: Process to evaluate the validity of other atoms (especially hypotheses)
- conclusion: Verified hypotheses or final problem solutions

When to use:
- Quick brainstorming sessions requiring atomic thought organization
- Time-sensitive problem solving where speed is prioritized over exhaustive analysis
- Simpler reasoning tasks that don't require deep decomposition
- Initial exploration before using the full AoT for deeper analysis
- Learning or demonstration purposes where response time is important

Key differences from full AoT:
- Lower maximum depth (3 instead of 5) for faster processing
- Simplified verification process
- Immediate conclusion suggestion for high-confidence hypotheses
- Reduced computational overhead and response payload
- Optimized for speed rather than exhaustive analysis
